# cloud-itonami-isco-1221

Open Business Blueprint for **ISCO-08 1221**: Sales and Marketing Managers — an ISCO
**Wave 1 (design & governance)** occupation per ADR-2607121000. This
is the FIRST wave-1 blueprint batch: management work is cognitive
(no robotics gate), sequenced after the wave-0 cognitive substrate in
rollout priority.

**Maturity: `:blueprint`** — blueprint only; **no actor implementation
yet**, and none is claimed. The implemented actor will follow the
fleet-standard pattern (advisor-LLM sealed behind the independent
`:sales-marketing-management-governor` governor, human approval workflow, append-only
audit ledger); management decisions with external or financial effect
are always :external-send / escalated, never auto-committed.

AGPL-3.0-or-later, forkable by any qualified operator. Part of the
[cloud-itonami](https://itonami.cloud) open business fleet.
